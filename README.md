- The home page is the screen the end user is presented with on page load. <br>
  All webpages have the same gray-colour background with white navigation bar and pale brown footer. Two colors have been used for fonts: brown and blue. The whole project is using warm brownish (coffee) design to fit the purpose of the website.

  Base.html template has been used as a parent template; it includes the basic html structure with all important links for frameworks and libraries needed for the website to function properly. 
  The parent template also includes the navigation bar and footer that are consistent across all web pages.
  This support the intuitiveness of the entire website and enhances the user experience and makes the website easy to use.

The aim is also to make the website useful and interesting for the users that are already signed up to come back and share their new delicious coffee recipes. 
  The home page also contains a message attached to the background image that explains why a user should register and the benefits they receive.

- __Recipe Page__

- On the Recipe page, a user can find any recipes shared by others or themselves. They also have the opportunity
  to search for a recipe if they are looking for a particular recipe or ingredients. 
  The website mostly consists of recipe cards with an image and a brief recipe description (recipe intro).
  If one of the shared recipes catches users' attention, they can click the Discover Recipes button on the bottom of the recipe card and open the entire recipe.
  The full recipe page includes all the details and instructions necessary to prepare a coffee drink, such as:
  recipe name, recipe brief description, preparation time and serving information as well as difficulty, and two most important sections - ingredients and method.
  It also shows a creator's username, category and a recipe image. 
  Overall the full-recipe is divided into 4 sections for bettter readability and user experience. In the ingredients section, every single ingredient is underlined and every step in the method section in numbered.

 __Sign Up / Log In Page__
- Signing Up to the website is very simple and straightforward. The aim was to keep it as simple as possible for users
  not to get discouraged by tedious registration process.
  Sign Up form includes Icon Prefixes for a better user experience and layout.
  All three fields: username, email and password need to be input in order to sign up.
  There are some restrictions when creating a username and password; username needs to have a minimum of 5 and maximum of 20 characters - all alphanumeric without spaces. Password needs to be at least 8 characters long and maximum of 20 - all alphanumeric and without spaces. 
  If a user input the correct details into the sign up form and the inputed username does not already exists, then they will be informed, they have been succesfully registered. Otherwise they will get a message asking them to fill in the form again. 
  All three fields have validation applied so if username, password or email do not meet criteria for signing up, red underline will appear. Green underline will indicate that all fields have been filled in correctly and the form is ready for submission. 
  Werkzeug "generate_password_hash" and "check_password_hash" method has been used for converting a user's password. 

  Log In Page includes two input fields that need to be filled in by a registered user in order to Log-In.
  Again, both have validation applied and will indicate if the criteria have been met. If the correct username and password have been used and they match the details on mongodb, a flash message will inform the user that they have been successfully logged in, otherwise a message will prompt the user to input the correct log-in details.

 __Profile Page__

 Profile Page is only available for registered users; here they can create their own coffee book. 
 It consists of a personalized greeting with a welcome message, 'Add new recipe' button to encourage a registered user to add a new recipe and share it with the coffee community as well as the most important part: tabs for created recipes and favourite recipes. In 'created recipes' tab are stored all recipies that the user has added and shared on the website. In 'favourite recipes' tab are stored all recipies saved to the coffeebook by the logged-in user. All created recipes can be edit or deleted and all favourite recipies can be removed from favouries and add to favouries again, if a user wish to. If no recipes created or added to favourites, messages will be displayed to prompt a user to create or save recipes. 
 A logged-in user can create their personalized coffee book that contains both their own recipes as well as recipes they discover and like while searching on recipes page.

Again, the adding form is simple and straightforward. It includes input fields for: recipe name, recipe image url, category, difficulty, preparation time, serves and the most important input fields: ingredients and method. 
Ingredients and method have a button to add extra fields to input ingredients or step of preparation separately in new lines (or paragraphs). All fields are required to fill in apart from recipe image url; if the recipe image url is not provided, a general image will be displayed instead.
All fields have validation applied or pre-populated format make it easy for a user to fill in the form and provide a correct details.

- Further testing has been done with Chrome DevTools, making sure that responsiveness works correctly on all devices.
  After the deployment, I tested the website link focusing on website functionality and CRUD operations and if all important features work as expected. No issues were detected. 

- The website was assessed in various browsers: Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.
  Live link was tested on Huawei P30, Samsung A50 to test smaller screen sizes, on a small display laptop - HP ProBook 430 and also on a larger display laptop - Dell Latitude 5580. <br>
  Each of the pages functioned well.


### Fixed Bugs
- Recipes in favourites did not display the content and showed blank - the issue has been resoved by converting array into strings. 

### Unfixed Bugs
There is an issue with Favicon, sometimes not displaying properly. Last time I resolved it by adding the crossorigin attribute.
However, it seems to be another isssue this time.

## Deployment
  For this project, I have used Gitpod as the IDE and the repository has been stored on GitHub. 
  The web application has been deployed on Heroku.
- There are two ways how to deploy an app on Heroku: <br> 
  a) Using Heroku command-line interface (CLI) /Heroku toolbelt
  b) Setting up automatic deployments from GitHub
  For this project,  the second option - Automatic Deployment - from my GitHub repository has been used:

- Setting up automatic deployments from GitHub: <br>
  1) Create an account on Heroku and once signed up click on the "Create New App" button.
       The app name must be unique - something that nobody else currently has and without spaces (use dash or minus instead of spaces) and all lowercase letters.
       Then select a region closest to you. 
  2) Go to Heroku 'Settings' Tab, click 'Reveal Config Vars' and input the following variables (do not include any quotes): 
        | **KEY** | **VALUE** | 
        |-------------|------------|  
        |IP  | 0.0.0.0 |
        |PORT  | 5000 |
        |SECRET_KEY | your_secret_key|
        |MONGO_URI | mongodb+srv://coffee:<password>@cluster3.jhm4r33.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
        |MONGO_DBNAME |	<database_name>|
  3) Go to Gitpod workspace and create a 'requirements.txt' file, which will install the dependencies 
        for the project, and tell Heroku that Python language is using.
        To create a requirements.txt file, type the following command in the terminal: <br>
        <strong>pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt</strong>
        Then Add, commit and push the file into Github:
        + git add -A or git add requirements.txt
        + git commit -m "Add requirements.txt".
        + git push 
  4) Create a Procfile. The Procfile tells Heroku how to run the application.
     To create Procfile, type the following command in the terminal: 
     <strong>echo web: python app.py > Procfile</strong>
     Then Add, commit and push the file into GitHub:
     + git add -A or git add Procfile
     + git commit -m "Add Procfile".
     + git push 
  5) Make sure all your code is pushed to your GitHub repository.
     + git add -A 
     + git commit -m "insert your message here"
     + git push 
  6) Go to the Heroku Deploy Tab and click 'GitHub (Connect to GitHub)' for 'Deployment Method'
  7) Make sure your GitHub profile is displayed, then provide your Github repository name and then click Search.
     Once it finds your repository, click to 'Connect' to this app.
  8) Click 'Enable Automatic Deploys'
  9) Choose a branch to deploy 'main' and then click 'Deploy Branch' on Heroku
  10) You will see a message: "Your app has been succesfully deployed"
      Click 'View' to lauch your new app.
